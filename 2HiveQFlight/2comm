CREATE TABLE flight(fno int, year int, dest varchar(10), delay float);

ALTER TABLE flight rename to air_flight;

         row format delimited
         fields terminated by ','
         lines terminated by '\n'

Create one text file named data.txt in Cloudera Home and paste this :

923,2009,Mumbai,60.0,15/8/2009
786,2008,Pune,78.0,14/5/2008
1156,2009,Nagar,0.0,13/3/2009

LOAD DATA local inpath 'data.txt' into table flight;

3. Creating a Table with File-Based Format
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE flight(fno int, year int, dest varchar(10), delay float, flight_date varchar(10))
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
Purpose: Creates a table flight to load data from a text file where:

Fields are comma-separated

Each row ends with a newline

Data is stored as plain text




5. Creating an External Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE nflight(fno int, year int, source varchar(10))
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
Purpose: Creates an external table nflight, meaning Hive will not delete the underlying data when the table is dropped.

8. Creating an Index
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX flight_index ON TABLE flight(fno)
AS 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler'
WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;
Purpose: Creates a compact index on the fno column for faster search. WITH DEFERRED REBUILD means the index won't be built until explicitly done later.

sql
Copy
Edit
SHOW TABLES;
Purpose: Lists all tables in the current database.

ðŸ“Š 9. Aggregation Query
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT flight_date, AVG(delay) AS avg_departure_delay
FROM flight
WHERE year = 2008
GROUP BY flight_date
ORDER BY flight_date;
Purpose:

Filters flights from the year 2008

Groups by flight_date

Calculates average delay for each date

Orders the result by date

Question	Answer
What is Hive?	Hive is a data warehouse tool for managing large datasets in Hadoop using SQL-like queries.
Difference between internal and external table in Hive?	Internal tables manage both data and metadata; deleting the table deletes the data. External tables only manage metadata.
What is the use of LOAD DATA LOCAL?	It loads a local file into a Hive table.
What is the use of ROW FORMAT DELIMITED?	It tells Hive how the data is formatted in the file.
Why do we create indexes in Hive?	To improve the performance of queries by allowing faster lookup of rows.
What is the use of GROUP BY and ORDER BY in Hive?	GROUP BY groups data for aggregation. ORDER BY sorts the result set.
What happens when you drop an external table?	The table is removed from Hive metadata, but the actual data remains.
Can you rename a Hive table?	Yes, using ALTER TABLE old_name RENAME TO new_name;.
What is WITH DEFERRED REBUILD?	It creates the index structure but delays building it until needed.
How do you load CSV data into Hive?	By creating a table with FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' and using LOAD DATA.

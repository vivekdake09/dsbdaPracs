1. Import Libraries
We use four libraries:

numpy: for numerical operations like mean, standard deviation

pandas: to load and manage data in a table-like format

matplotlib.pyplot: to display visual graphs

seaborn: for advanced and attractive data visualizations

2. Load Dataset
The dataset heart.csv is loaded using pandas.
We check the column names using .columns and view the dataset to understand its structure.

3. Bar Plot
A bar plot is used to compare the average cholesterol (chol) level between males and females (sex).
If we use estimator=np.std, the bar plot will show the standard deviation instead of the average.

4. Count Plot
This plot counts the number of entries per category, here showing the number of males and females in the dataset. It helps us understand the data distribution.

5. Box Plot
Box plot displays the median, quartiles, and outliers of a dataset.
It helps us understand how chol (cholesterol) varies by gender.

6. Violin Plot
Similar to a box plot, but also shows the shape of the data distribution using curves.
Using hue='cp', we can further break down the violin plot by chest pain type (cp).

7. Distribution Plot (Distplot)
Shows the distribution of a numeric column, such as thalachh (maximum heart rate).
It combines a histogram with a smooth density curve (KDE).
Using kde=False, we only see the histogram.

8. Joint Plot
Displays a scatter plot between two variables, like thalachh and sex, with histograms on the sides.
When we use kind='hex', the plot becomes a hexbin plot, where color intensity shows data density.

9. Rug Plot
Adds small tick marks along the axis to show individual data points.
It's usually combined with other plots.

10. Strip Plot
Shows all individual values as small dots.
Using jitter=True spreads overlapping dots sideways.
Adding hue='cp' shows color for different chest pain types.

11. Swarm Plot
Similar to strip plot, but adjusts dot positions to avoid overlapping, giving a clearer view.
Can also use hue='cp' to separate categories with color.

12. Correlation Matrix
The .corr() function shows how much each pair of numeric variables is related.
Values close to 1 mean strong positive correlation, -1 means strong negative correlation.

13. Heatmap
Displays the correlation matrix using colors.
Using annot=True shows the actual correlation numbers on the plot.
This helps identify which features are related to each other.

Important Keywords to Remember

Bar Plot: Compares averages

Count Plot: Shows counts of categories

Box Plot: Summarizes distribution with medians and outliers

Violin Plot: Combines box plot and density curve

Distplot: Shows histogram and KDE

Joint Plot: Shows relationship between two variables

Rug Plot: Tick marks for individual values

Strip Plot: Shows all data points

Swarm Plot: Smart arrangement of points to avoid overlap

Heatmap: Color-coded correlation matrix

Correlation: Measures how closely two variables move together

Viva Questions & Answers

Q: What is the purpose of a bar plot?
A: It shows the average or other statistical measures (like standard deviation) of a variable for each category.

Q: What does estimator=np.std do in a bar plot?
A: It changes the bar plot to show standard deviation instead of the average.

Q: What is the use of a count plot?
A: It shows how many times each category appears in the data.

Q: Why is a box plot useful?
A: It helps us see the spread, median, and outliers of data.

Q: How is a violin plot different from a box plot?
A: It shows the same summary as a box plot, but also includes the data distribution shape using KDE.

Q: What is KDE in distplot?
A: KDE stands for Kernel Density Estimate, which draws a smooth curve over the histogram.

Q: What does a joint plot show?
A: It shows the relationship between two variables along with their individual distributions.

Q: What is a heatmap used for?
A: It visualizes the correlation between numerical features using colors.

Q: What does a correlation value of 1 mean?
A: It means a perfect positive correlation; the two variables increase together.

Q: What is the difference between a strip plot and a swarm plot?
A: Strip plot may have overlapping dots, while swarm plot arranges them to avoid overlap.
